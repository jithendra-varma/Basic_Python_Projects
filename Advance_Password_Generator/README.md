In this password generator you can generate three types of passwords.
You can choice them with the following three numbers 0,1,2 respectively.

1. '0' for Normal Random Password

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a normal random password generator which takes the length of the password as input and outputs the string of letters chosen randomly from a list of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, punctuations.

2. '1' for Random Password which follow the rules

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes length of the password as input and is coded to have one Upper_Case letter, one Number, one Punctuation mark and the remaining length is filled with Lower_Case alphabet letters.

3. '2' for Random Password with meaningful words

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes two inputs first one being the password length and the second one takes the no of words to be used in the process and returns the string of words based on the input. For this we are using a words.txt file which contains the words from a dictionary.
