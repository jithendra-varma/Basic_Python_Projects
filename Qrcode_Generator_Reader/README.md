# Qr Code Generator and Reader

This is a python project in which you can create and read QR Codes using python programming language. I used the python module qrcode and opencv for the development of this project. We have three options in this python program for variuos purposes.

1. '0' Basic QR Code Generation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This option takes data, image name as input parameters and returns the QR Code as output with the input filename.png format.

2. '1' Advanced QR Code Generation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This option takes several other inputs like version, error_correction, box_size, border, fill_color, back_color 
and the main inputs Data and File name for generating the QR Code with the given imagename.

3. '2' Reading a QR Code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This option takes {imagename}.png as input and returns the data encoded in the QR Code as string by decoding the image.
